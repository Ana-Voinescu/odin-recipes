# Odin Recipes

This project is part of my journey into learning web development through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), focusing on building a multi-page website using **HTML** and **CSS**.

## üßÅ Project Overview

The website includes:
- A **main index page** that links to 3 individual **recipe pages**.
- Each recipe page contains a description, ingredients list, and step-by-step instructions.

## üí° What I Learned

### HTML:
- Semantic HTML structure (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<ul>`, `<p>`, etc.)
- Internal linking between pages using `<a>` tags
- Structuring image elements with `alt` text and setting attributes like `height` and `width`
- Organizing files into folders (e.g., `/recipes`, `/images`)
- Writing clean and readable code using indentation and comments

### CSS:
- Creating and linking an external stylesheet (`style.css`)
- Styling text with `font-family`, `color`, `font-size`
- Page layout using `text-align`, margins, and centering content
- Applying background colors and basic typography
- Using `class` and `id` selectors effectively
- Overriding styles for specific elements
- Understanding the **Box Model** and how it affects layout
