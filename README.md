# odin-recipes
This project is part of my journey into learning web development, starting with the basics of HTML.  
The goal is to build a simple website that includes a main index page linking to a few recipe pages.

While the website may not look visually appealing yet, the focus of this project is on building strong HTML fundamentals.  
I will revisit this project later to apply CSS and improve its design.

Through this project, I aim to reinforce the concepts Iâ€™ve learned so far and gain confidence in creating structured and semantic HTML documents.
